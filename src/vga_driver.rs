// repr transparent make Buffer ins has same memory layout as chars field

// 1. A 2D array is stored in the computer's memory one row following another.
//
// 2. The address of the first byte of memory is considered as the memory location of the entire 2D array.
//
// 3. Knowing the address of the first byte of memory, the compiler can easily compute
// to find the memory location of any other elements in the 2D array provided the number of columns in the array is known.
//
// 4. If each data value of the array requires B bytes of memory, and if the array has C columns,
// then the memory location of an element such as score[m][n] is (m*c+n)*B from the address of the first byte.
//
// 5. Note that to find the memory location of any element, there is no need to know the total number of rows in the array,
// i.e. the size of the first dimension. Of course the size of the first dimension is needed to prevent reading or storing data that is out of bounds.
//
// 6. Again one should not think of a 2D array as just an array with two indexes.
// You should think of it as an array of arrays.
//
// 7. Higher dimensional arrays should be similarly interpreted.
// For example a 3D array should be thought of as an array of arrays of arrays.
// To find the memory location of any element in the array relative to the address of the first byte,
// the sizes of all dimensions other than the first must be known.
//
// 8. Knowledge of how multidimensional arrays are stored in memory
// helps one understand how they can be initialized, and how they can be passed as function arguments.
/// ```
/// let s1 = String::from("hello")
///
///         s1                                memory
/// |   name  | value |                 | index | value |
/// |   ptr   |   --------------------->|   0   |   h   |
